Output Format Explanation:

The chosen output format for displaying the converted temperatures is "XK is equal to Y째Z." where:
- X is the input temperature value in Kelvin.
- Y is the converted temperature value rounded to two decimal places.
- Z is the target temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Newton).

Rationale:
1. Including the input temperature value (X) provides context to the user and reminds them of the original value they entered.
2. Rounding the converted temperature value (Y) to two decimal places provides a reasonable level of precision without overwhelming the user with unnecessary decimal places.
3. Including the target temperature scale (Z) helps the user understand the units of the converted temperature.

Example output:
- 300K is equal to 26.85째C.
- 500K is equal to 440.33째F.
- 100K is equal to 33.00째N.
